# Procedure 

# 1. Load the dataset as a new dataframe called caffeine.

# loading the necessary library:
library(readr) 

# loading the dataset 
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndphillips/ThePiratesGuideToR/master/data/caffeinestudy.txt"

# loading as 'caffeine' dataframe
caffeine <- read.table(url, header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# 2. Write R code to calculate and print:

# installing and loading dplyr
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

# a. the mean age for each gender.

# pipe operator for readability
caffeine %>% 
  
# grouping based on gender
group_by(gender) %>% 
  
# result
summarise(mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE))

# b. the mean age for each drink.
caffeine %>% 
group_by(drink) %>% 
summarise(mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE))

# c. the mean age for each combined level of both gender and drink
caffeine %>% 
group_by(gender, drink) %>% 
summarise(mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE))

# d. the median score for each age
caffeine %>% 
group_by(age) %>% 
summarise(median_score = median(score, na.rm = TRUE))

# 3. For men only, write R code to calculate and print the maximum score for 
# each age.

# assigning a new variable 
max_score_for_men <- caffeine %>%
  
# filtering male gender
filter(gender == "male") %>%
  
# grouping by age, retrieving the maximum score for each age for men only
group_by(age) %>%
  
# result
summarise(max_score = max(score, na.rm = TRUE))

# printing the result
print(max_score_for_men)

# 4. Create a dataframe showing, for each level of drink, the mean, median, 
# maximum, and standard deviation of scores.

# assigning a new variable
stats_by_drink <- caffeine %>%
  
# retrieving the 5 number summary for just the drinks
group_by(drink) %>%
  
# result
summarise(
    mean_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_score = median(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_score = max(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_score = sd(score, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Printing the result
print(stats_by_drink)

# 5. Write R code to plot the contents of the dataframe created in the previous 
# step in a visually pleasant and informative way.

# installing and loading tidyverse
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

#assigning a new variable
drink_stats_plot <- stats_by_drink %>%
  
# reshaping the data
pivot_longer(cols = -drink, names_to = "statistic", values_to = "value")

# Create the plot with ggplot2; details to make the plot visually pleasing
ggplot(drink_stats_plot, aes(x = drink, y = value, group = statistic, color = statistic)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Score Statistics by Drink Level",
       x = "Drink",
       y = "Score Value",
       color = "Statistic") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))

# 6. Only for females above the age of 20, create a table showing, for each 
# combined level of drink and cups, the mean, median, maximum, and standard 
# deviation of scores. Also include a column showing how many people were in 
# each group.

# assigning a new variable
female_drink_stats <- caffeine %>%

# filtering females above the age of 20  
filter(gender == "female" & age > 20) %>%
  
# groupong by cups
group_by(drink, cups) %>%

# result  
summarise(
    mean_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_score = median(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_score = max(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_score = sd(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# printing the result
print(female_drink_stats)

# 7. Write R code to plot the contents of the table created in the previous 
# step in a visually pleasant and informative way.

# assigning a new variable
female_drink_stats_long <- female_drink_stats %>%

# reshaping the data to plot it  
pivot_longer(cols = c(mean_score, median_score, max_score), 
               names_to = "statistic", values_to = "value")

# plotting
ggplot_female_drink_stats <- ggplot(female_drink_stats_long, aes(x = interaction(drink, cups), y = value, fill = statistic)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  facet_wrap(~ statistic, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Score Statistics by Drink Type and Cups for Females Over Age 20",
       x = "Drink-Cups",
       y = "Score Value",
       fill = "Statistic") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# printing the plot
print(ggplot_female_drink_stats)

# 8. Write R code to answer the following questions:

# QUESTION 1: What is the correlation between test scores and type of drink?

# calculating anova test and summary
anova_result <- aov(score ~ drink, data = caffeine)
summary(anova_result)

# QUESTION 2: What is the correlation between test scores and amount of drink?

# calculating correlation coefficient
correlation_score_cups <- cor(caffeine$score, caffeine$cups, use = "complete.obs")
print(correlation_score_cups)

# QUESTION 3: What is the correlation between test scores and age?

# calculating the correlation coefficient
correlation_score_age <- cor(caffeine$score, caffeine$age, use = "complete.obs")
print(correlation_score_age)

# QUESTION 4: What is the correlation between test scores and gender?

# ensuring gender is a factor with two levels
caffeine$gender <- factor(caffeine$gender, levels = c("male", "female"))

# converting gender to a binary variable: 0 for male, 1 for female
caffeine$gender_numeric <- as.numeric(caffeine$gender == "female")

# calculating the correlation between score and gender
correlation_score_gender <- cor(caffeine$score, caffeine$gender_numeric, use = "complete.obs")

# printing the correlation
print(correlation_score_gender)

# QUESTION 5: What can we conclude from this study (and how does the data 
# support such conclusion)?

# Based on the data, we can make several observations, such as whether 
# performance increases (or decreases) with each different type of drink. We
# can also observe whether certain drink improve performance in particular age
# groups, and how much that may or may not change based on gender.

# Optional

# 1. Write R code to generate a scatterplot of the performance versus age, for 
# different types of drink and comment of the result.

# loading ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# plotting
ggplot(caffeine, aes(x = age, y = score, color = drink)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Performance vs. Age for Different Types of Drink",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Performance Score",
       color = "Type of Drink") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# 2. Write R code to generate a scatterplot of the performance versus age, 
# for different amounts of drink and comment of the result.

# plotting
scatter_plot <- ggplot(caffeine, aes(x = age, y = score, color = as.factor(cups))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +  # Set transparency to see overlapping points
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Performance vs. Age by Amount of Drink",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Performance Score",
       color = "Amount of Drink (cups)") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# printing the scatter plot
print(scatter_plot)

# 3. Write R code to generate a scatterplot of the performance versus age, for 
# different genders and comment of the result.

# plotting
scatter_plot_gender <- ggplot(caffeine, aes(x = age, y = score, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +  # Use alpha to make points slightly transparent
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Performance vs. Age by Gender",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Performance Score",
       color = "Gender") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# printing the scatter plot
print(scatter_plot_gender)

# 4. What can you conclude from this study based on the three scatterplots 
# above?

# Based on the data, we can make several observations, such as whether 
# performance increases (or decreases) with each different type of drink. We
# can also observe whether certain drink improve performance in particular age
# groups, and how much that may or may not change based on gender.

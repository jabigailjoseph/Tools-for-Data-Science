# Fundamentals of R for Data Science

## Introduction

R is a powerful programming language and environment for statistical computing and data analysis. It is widely used in data science and is known for its extensive libraries and packages for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling. This README serves as a beginner's guide to the fundamentals and essentials of R for data science.

## Prerequisites

Before you start learning R for data science, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- R Installation: Download and install R from the official R project website (https://www.r-project.org/).

- RStudio (optional but recommended): RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that provides a user-friendly interface and enhanced functionality for data science tasks. You can download it from the RStudio website (https://www.rstudio.com/).
